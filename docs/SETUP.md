# Installation & Setup Guide

This document outlines the end-to-end installation process for deploying the FiveM Log Management System in a production or development environment.

---

## 1. System Requirements

Before beginning, ensure your host machine (or isolated VPS instances) meet the following prerequisites:

- **Node.js:** v22.0 or higher.
- **MySQL:** v8.0 or higher (MariaDB equivalent is compatible).
- **Elasticsearch:** v9.x or higher (A single node is sufficient for most medium servers).
- **PM2 / Screen:** For managing background application processes in a production setting.
- **Discord Developer Application:** Required for OAuth2 staff logins.

## 2. Elasticsearch Installation

Elasticsearch is the backbone of the logging system's timeseries storage.

1. Download and install Elasticsearch following the official guide for your OS.
2. Start the Elasticsearch service.
3. Verify that the node is running locally:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "localhost:9200/"
   ```

---

## 3. Database Initialization

The relational state of the application (configurations, users, channels) is governed by MySQL.

1. Access your MySQL terminal:
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p
   ```
2. Create the database and import the schema script:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE fivem_logs;
   USE fivem_logs;
   source backend/database/schema.sql;
   ```
3. Ensure the tables (`servers`, `users`, `user_server_access`, `log_channels`, etc.) have been populated successfully.

---

## 4. Backend Service Configuration (Ingest)

The backend service is responsible for ingesting logs and bridging Elasticsearch queries. It does not connect to MySQL.

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
2. Copy the template environment file:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```
3. Ensure your Elasticsearch URL is correct inside `.env` (`ELASTICSEARCH_NODE=http://localhost:9200`).
4. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm run prod
   ```
   *Note: Use PM2 or a systemd service file to keep this running permanently.*

---

## 5. Discord Application Registration

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Click **New Application**. Name it appropriately.
3. Navigate to the **OAuth2** tab.
4. Add a redirect URI matching where your dashboard will reside:
   - Development: `http://localhost:3001/api/auth/callback`
   - Production: `https://logs.yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback`
5. Note down your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

## 6. Dashboard Deployment (Frontend)

The frontend visualizer runs via Next.js and connects to both MySQL (for settings/auth) and the Backend Ingest service.

1. Navigate to the `dashboard` directory:
   ```bash
   cd dashboard
   npm install
   ```
2. Copy the `.env` template:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env.local
   ```
3. Update `.env.local` exactly:
   ```text
   MYSQL_HOST=localhost
   MYSQL_USER=your_user
   MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_pass
   MYSQL_DATABASE=fivem_logs

   # Generate a secure JWT secret: openssl rand -hex 32
   JWT_SECRET=super_secure_random_string

   DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=copied_from_step_5
   DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=copied_from_step_5
   DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3001/api/auth/callback

   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```
4. Build and start the Next.js production server:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

---

## 7. Configuration Defaults

Make sure to assign yourself access to a server context to use the Dashboard!

1. Open your MySQL client and find the `servers` table.
2. Insert a new server defining your identifier and a custom `api_key`:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO servers (identifier, name, api_key) 
   VALUES ('rp_server_1', 'Main Roleplay Server', 'fivem_3d31edce-c1a9-4ba1-837c-f905232c4a1e');
   ```
3. Grant yourself access to this server via your Discord user ID inside `user_server_access`.
4. The Backend Lua ingest code inside your FiveM server utilizes `sv_projectName` (which evaluates as `rp_server_1` based on your `server.cfg`). Read `docs/INTEGRATION.md` for finalizing the FiveM game server scripts.
